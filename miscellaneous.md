    <h3>(Feynman Volume II Derivation)</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
    On page 21-1 in Volume II of The Feynman Lectures on Physics, the equation for the electric field of an electron moving in an arbitrary direction (shown on right) is presented and some of the details about the equation are discussed.
    </p>
    <p>
    Further along (page 21-11) Feynman sort of challenges the reader in the footnote to fully derive the equation and I thought it would be useful to try to derive the equation and that it would be good practice
